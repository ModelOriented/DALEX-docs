# Ceteris Paribus Profiles {#ceterisParibus}

*NOTE: This chapter is still a work in progress. Expect changes.*

In this chapter we introduce a model agnostic method for model exploration based on the Ceteris Paribus principle ^[Ceteris paribus is a Latin phrase meaning  "other things held constant" or "all else unchanged".]. This universal method helps to understand both local and global structure of a model, helps to compare few models and is useful in diagnostic of model fit.

Some specific versions of this method are in literature under different names, as Partial Dependence Plots [@pdp], Individual Conditional Expectation Plots (ICEPlots) or Accumulated Local Effects Plots [@ALEPlot]. Here we present an uniform yet more extensible approach. We adopt a new name for this approach, namely Ceteris Paribus Profiles, as it better described the idea behind.

This chapter is divided into 5 sections. Each introduces a different aspect of Ceteris Paribus Profiles (CPP).

* Section \@ref(cetParSingleObseSingleModel) introduces Ceteris Paribus profiles for a single observation and a single model. This section introduces basic concepts and notation behind CPP.

* Section \@ref(cetParLocalObseSingleModel) show how to combine set of CP profiles around a single data point in orded to inspect a model locally. This allows to assess model stability, additivness and local fit.

* Section \@ref(cetParGlobalObseSingleModel) show how to combine CP profiles for all observations in order to inspect global features of a model. 

* Section \@ref(cetParGlobalObseMultipleModels) shows how CP profiles can be used for model comparisons on any level. Examples are related to single observation, local and global CP profiles.

* Section \@ref(cetParSingleObseManyModel) shows how different profiles can be aligned on a single plot.


In this chapter we show examples for three predictive models trained on `apartments` dataset from the `DALEX` package. Random Forest model (elastic but biased), Support Vector Machines model (large variance on boundaries) and Linear Model (stable but not very elastic). 
Presented examples are for regression (prediction of square meter price), but the CP profiles may be used in the same way for classification.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("DALEX")
# Linear model trained on apartments data
model_lm <- lm(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + 
                      no.rooms + district, data = apartments)

library("randomForest")
set.seed(59)
# Random Forest model trained on apartments data
model_rf <- randomForest(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + 
                      no.rooms + district, data = apartments)

library("e1071")
# Support Vector Machinesr model trained on apartments data
model_svm <- svm(m2.price ~ construction.year + surface + floor + 
                         no.rooms + district, data = apartments)
```

For these models we use `DALEX` explainers created with `explain()` function. There exapliners  wrap models, predict functions and validation data.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
explainer_lm <- explain(model_lm, 
                       data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price)
explainer_rf <- explain(model_rf, 
                       data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price)
explainer_svm <- explain(model_svm, 
                       data = apartmentsTest[,2:6], y = apartmentsTest$m2.price)
```

Examples presented in this chapter are generated with the `ceterisParibus` package in version `r installed.packages()["ceterisParibus","Version"]`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## Ceteris Paribus profiles for a single observation  {#cetParSingleObseSingleModel}

Let $f_{M}(x): \mathcal R^{d} \rightarrow \mathcal R$ denote a predictive model, i.e. function that takes $d$ dimensional vector and calculate numerical score. In section in which we work with larger number of models we use subscript $M$ to index models. But to simplify notation, this subscript is omitted if profiles for only one model are considered. 

Symbol $x \in \mathcal R^d$ refers to a point in the feature space. We use subscript $x_i$ to refer to a different data points and superscript $x^j$ to refer to specific dimensions. Additionally, let $x^{-j}$ denote all coordinates except $j$-th and let $x|^j=z$ denote a data point $x^*$ with all coordinates equal to $x$ except coordinate $j$ equal to value $z$. I.e. $\forall_{i \neq {j}} x^i = x^{*,i}$ and $x^j = z$. In other words $x|^j=z$ denote a $x$ with $j$th coordinate changed to $z$.

Now we can define Ceteris Paribus Profile for model $f$, variable $j$ and point $x$ as

$$
CP^{f, j, x}(z) := f(x|^j = z).
$$
I.e. CP profile is a model response obtained for observations created based on $x$ with $j$ coordinated changes and all other coordinates kept unchanged.

It is convenient to use an alternative name What-If Plots, since these profiles show what would happen if only a single variable is changed.


#### Example

Let's assume that we have a new apartment with following attributes.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
aplevels <- levels(apartments$district)

new_apartment <- data.frame(construction.year = 2000, 
                            surface = 100,
                            floor = 1L,
                            no.rooms = 4,
                            district = factor("Bemowo", levels = aplevels))
new_apartment
```

And we are interested in the predicted price for this apartment calculated with the random forest model `model_rf`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
predict(model_rf, new_apartment)
```

We also know, that the variable `construction.year` is used in the model. So how would the model response change for different values of `construction.year` attribute?

Based on this observation we create $N$ virtual apartments with `construction.year` span between 1920 and 2010. New values for this attribute are selected from empirical distribution of the `apartments$construction.year` variable. By default $N = 101$ so percentiles are used for new values of `construction.year`. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
profile_rf <- ceteris_paribus(explainer_rf, observations = new_apartment)
profile_rf
```

Also note, that the `apartments` data is available in the model explainer specified as the first parameter of the `ceteris_paribus` function.

These artificial apartments constitute profile of conditional model response for different values of `construction.year`. Such profiles may be plotted with the generic `plot()` function. Note that the `ceteris_paribus()` function by default calculates profiles for every variable in the dataset (this can be changes with the `variables` parameter). 

We use `selected_variables` parameter in the `plot()` function to limit plot to only a single variable `construction.year`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(profile_rf, selected_variables = "construction.year")
```
