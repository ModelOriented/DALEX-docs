# Exercises

Examples in previous chapters were based on random forest model and linear model.
But there are so many different approaches for regression modeling.
Try `gbm` (Generalized Boosted Regression Models), `knn` (k-Nearest Neighbour), `svm` (Support Vector Machines), `nnet` (Neural Networks) or other models.

1. Prepare explainers for model performance,
2. Prepare explainers for variable importance,
3. Prepare explainers for variable response for `construction.year`,
4. Prepare explainers for model predictions.

Below you will find fits for few different models. Try them out.
